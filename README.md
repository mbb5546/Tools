This repo is a collection or various scripts/tools I use or am actively playing around with to aide in various penetration testing tasks. Use at your own risk, dont perform anything illegal. 


## Prep-Ligolo.sh
This script helps automate the process of setting up a network interface for Ligolo-NG and also lets you add routes to desired subnets in preparation for pivoting needs.
